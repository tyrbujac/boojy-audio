## Quality Guidelines

- All samples recorded/rendered at 24-bit, 44.1kHz minimum
- Instruments should have 2-3 velocity layers where appropriate
- Round-robin for drums (2-3 variations per hit) to avoid machine-gun effect
- Synth presets fully mapped with mod wheel and aftertouch where useful
- Every sound usable out of the box - no filler
