## Vision

Boojy Audio is a free, open-source, cross-platform DAW designed to fill the gap between beginner-friendly but limited tools (GarageBand) and powerful but overwhelming professional software (Ableton, Logic, Pro Tools).

Part of the larger **Boojy creative software suite**, it aims to be the first DAW that is simultaneously accessible to beginners and capable enough for serious production.

### Core Principles

- **Performance first** — Runs smoothly on modest hardware
- **Minimal but complete** — Every feature polished, nothing half-done
- **Progressive disclosure** — Simple by default, powerful when needed
- **Cross-platform** — Same experience on Mac, Windows, Linux, and Web
- **Ecosystem thinking** — Designed as part of the Boojy suite from day one

### Boojy Suite Branding

Each app in the Boojy suite uses a letter in its name as a cloud connection status indicator:

| App | Status Letter | Connected | Offline | Error |
|-----|---------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Boojy Audio | O (outline) | Blue | Yellow | Red |
| Boojy Video | O (filled) | Blue | Yellow | Red |
| Boojy Design | D | Blue | Yellow | Red |

---

## Design References

Each major feature draws inspiration from the best existing implementation:

| Feature | Primary Reference | Reasoning |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Piano Roll | FL Studio | Gold standard — ghost notes, scale highlighting, intuitive interactions |
| Arrangement View | Studio One | Draggable sections, scratch pads, excellent drag-and-drop |
| Audio Recording | Logic Pro | Excellent comping, beginner-friendly, professional results |
| Audio Editing/Warping | Ableton Live | Best-in-class warping, intuitive, sounds good |
| Automation | Studio One / Bitwig | Inline lanes below tracks, no mode switching, multiple visible |
| Mixer | Ableton Live | Minimal, readable, clean |
| Stock Sounds | Logic Pro | High quality, well-organized, massive library |
| Stock Effects | Ableton Live | Simple interfaces, hard to mess up, good defaults |
| UI Design | Logic Pro | Cohesive, polished, modern but timeless |
| Sidechaining | Logic Pro | Simple dropdown in compressor, easy to discover |
