# Boojy Audio - MVP Specification (v1.0)

**Last Updated:** December 26, 2025
**Status:** In Development (M7 Complete, Export Feature Complete)
**Target Platform:** macOS 12+, Windows 10+, iOS 15+ (iPad support added)

---

## Vision

Boojy Audio is a free, open-source, cross-platform DAW designed to fill the gap between beginner-friendly but limited tools (GarageBand) and powerful but overwhelming professional software (Ableton, Logic, Pro Tools).

Part of the larger **Boojy creative software suite**, it aims to be the first DAW that is simultaneously accessible to beginners and capable enough for serious production.

---

## Core Principles

- **Performance first** — Runs smoothly on modest hardware
- **Minimal but complete** — Every feature polished, nothing half-done
- **Progressive disclosure** — Simple by default, powerful when needed
- **Cross-platform** — Same experience on Mac, Windows, Linux, and Web
- **Ecosystem thinking** — Designed as part of the Boojy suite from day one

---

## Philosophy

**Boojy Audio is:**
- **Beautiful, simple, cross-platform DAW** (macOS first, iPad/iPhone later)
- **GarageBand ease-of-use + Ableton power** (accessible to beginners, powerful for pros)
- **Hide complexity, focus on music-making** (no overwhelming options, clean UI)
- **Audio recording first, MIDI second** (optimized for recording, mixing, editing)

**Core Values:**
- **Free forever** - No paywalls, no track limits, no subscriptions
- **Open-source** - GPL v3, community-driven, transparent
- **Modern design** - Beautiful UI, Ableton-inspired, not dated
- **Cross-platform** - macOS, iPad, iPhone, Web (future: Windows, Linux)
- **Privacy-first** - No data selling, no tracking, local-first

---

## Design References

Each major feature draws inspiration from the best existing implementation:

| Feature | Primary Reference | Reasoning |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Piano Roll | FL Studio | Gold standard — ghost notes, scale highlighting, intuitive interactions |
| Arrangement View | Studio One | Draggable sections, scratch pads, excellent drag-and-drop |
| Audio Recording | Logic Pro | Excellent comping, beginner-friendly, professional results |
| Audio Editing/Warping | Ableton Live | Best-in-class warping, intuitive, sounds good |
| Automation | Studio One / Bitwig | Inline lanes below tracks, no mode switching, multiple visible |
| Mixer | Ableton Live | Minimal, readable, clean |
| Stock Sounds | Logic Pro | High quality, well-organized, massive library |
| Stock Effects | Ableton Live | Simple interfaces, hard to mess up, good defaults |
| UI Design | Logic Pro | Cohesive, polished, modern but timeless |
| Sidechaining | Logic Pro | Simple dropdown in compressor, easy to discover |

## Core Features (v1.0)

### Audio Engine

**Sample Rate & Bit Depth:**
- Auto-detect from audio interface (44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz)
