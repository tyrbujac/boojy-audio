# Boojy Audio — Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Target:** v1 MVP (macOS + iPad)
**Timeline:** 3–6 months (adjust based on availability)
**Tech Stack:** Flutter (UI) + Rust (audio engine) + Firebase Firestore (cloud)

**Related Documentation:**

- [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) — Complete feature specification for all versions
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) — Vision, timeline, and strategic overview
- [UI_DESIGN.md](UI_DESIGN.md) — UI specifications and component details

## Overview

This document breaks the MVP into **7 actionable milestones** (M1–M7), each representing ~2–4 weeks of work. Each milestone is demoable and builds toward the full v1 feature set defined in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).

**Development Philosophy:**
- Build **vertical slices** (end-to-end features) rather than horizontal layers
- Prototype early, refine later
- Ship each milestone in a working state (even if rough)
- Test on macOS first, iPad second

## M5.5: UI Redesign (October 26, 2025)

**Goal:** Transform UI from basic dark theme to professional 3-panel DAW layout with light grey theme.

**Duration:** 1 day
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What Was Implemented

#### New Layout Structure
- ✅ **3-Panel Layout:** Library (left) + Timeline (center) + Mixer (right)
- ✅ **LibraryPanel Widget:** 4 categories (Sounds, Instruments, Effects, Plug-Ins)
- ✅ **Always-Visible Mixer:** Mixer panel permanently visible on right (300px)
- ✅ **BottomPanel Widget:** Tabbed interface (Piano Roll, FX Chain, Virtual Piano)
- ✅ **TrackHeader Widget:** Track headers in timeline with S/M buttons and level meters
- ✅ **Consolidated Transport Bar:** Logo, controls, and file/mixer buttons in single bar

#### Light Grey Theme (Ableton-Style)
- ✅ **Side Panels:** Medium grey (#707070) for library, mixer, transport, bottom panel
- ✅ **Center Timeline:** Light grey (#909090) - lighter than sides to draw focus
- ✅ **Dark Text:** All text changed from light grey to dark grey/black (#202020) for contrast
- ✅ **Borders:** Light grey (#909090) instead of dark
- ✅ **Status Bar:** Darker grey (#606060) to anchor bottom

#### Color Palette Documentation
```
Side Panels (Library, Mixer, Transport):
  Background: #707070 (medium grey)
  Headers:    #656565 (slightly darker)
  Borders:    #909090 (light grey)

Center Timeline:
  Background: #909090 (light grey)
  Tracks:     #9A9A9A (even lighter)
  Borders:    #AAAAAA (subtle)
  Grid:       #A0A0A0

Text (Dark on Light):
  Primary:    #202020 (very dark grey)
  Secondary:  #353535 (dark grey)
  Tertiary:   #505050 (medium-dark)
  Icons:      #404040

Accent Colors (unchanged):
  Green:   #4CAF50
  Red:     #FF5722
  Yellow:  #FFC107
  Blue:    #2196F3
```

### Files Created
1. `ui/lib/widgets/library_panel.dart` - Left sidebar browser
2. `ui/lib/widgets/track_header.dart` - Timeline track headers
3. `ui/lib/widgets/bottom_panel.dart` - Tabbed bottom panel

### Files Modified
1. `ui/lib/screens/daw_screen.dart` - 3-column layout
2. `ui/lib/widgets/transport_bar.dart` - Logo + file/mixer buttons
3. `ui/lib/widgets/mixer_panel.dart` - Always-visible, reduced width
4. `ui/lib/widgets/timeline_view.dart` - Multi-track with headers
5. `ui/lib/widgets/bottom_panel.dart` - Tab integration
6. All widgets updated with light grey color scheme

### Design Decisions
- **Light theme chosen** for better visibility and modern aesthetic (similar to Ableton Live)
- **Center focus:** Timeline lighter than side panels to draw attention to workspace
- **Dark text:** Better contrast and readability on light backgrounds
- **Panel proportions:** Library 12% | Timeline 63% | Mixer 25%
- **Single transport bar:** Logo moved from AppBar to transport bar for cleaner layout

### Future UI Enhancements
See "UI/UX Enhancement Roadmap" section below for planned improvements in M7-M9.

## M5.5: UI Polish & Resizable Panels

**Goal:** Professional UI with resizable panels and layout persistence.

**Duration:** 1 week
**Deliverable:** Draggable panel dividers, sizes saved per project, master track at bottom.

### Tasks Completed

#### Master Track Repositioning
- [x] Move master track to bottom of timeline
- [x] Move master track to bottom of mixer panel
- [x] Use Spacer widget to push master to bottom
- [x] Ensure master stays at bottom even with no other tracks

#### Resizable Panel Dividers
- [x] Create ResizableDivider widget (vertical/horizontal)
- [x] Add divider between Library and Timeline (drag to resize library width)
- [x] Add divider between Timeline and Mixer (drag to resize mixer width)
- [x] Add divider between Timeline and Bottom Panel (drag to resize bottom height)
- [x] Implement double-click to collapse/expand functionality
- [x] Add hover effects (highlight, cursor change)
- [x] Add min/max size constraints

#### UI Layout Persistence
- [x] Create ui_layout.json format (version, panel_sizes, panel_collapsed)
- [x] Save panel sizes on project save
- [x] Load panel sizes on project open
- [x] Gracefully handle missing ui_layout.json (use defaults)

#### UI Improvements
- [x] Move zoom controls from bottom bar to top-right corner (+40px vertical space)
- [x] Replace bottom Audio/MIDI buttons with + button in mixer header
- [x] Add dropdown menu for track creation (Audio Track / MIDI Track)
- [x] Improve track creation UX (more discoverable for beginners)

### Success Criteria
✅ Panels can be resized by dragging dividers
✅ Double-click dividers collapses/expands panels
✅ Panel sizes persist across app restarts
✅ Master track always at bottom of timeline and mixer
✅ Timeline has +40px more vertical space (zoom bar removed)
✅ Track creation is more discoverable (+ button vs hidden buttons)

### Files Modified
- `lib/widgets/resizable_divider.dart` (new)
- `lib/screens/daw_screen.dart` (added panel size state, save/load methods)
- `lib/widgets/timeline_view.dart` (master at bottom, zoom moved)
- `lib/widgets/track_mixer_panel.dart` (master at bottom, + button)
- `lib/widgets/mixer_panel.dart` (updated but not used in current UI)

### Design Decisions
- **Ableton-inspired dividers:** 1px subtle lines that highlight on hover (3px green when dragging)
- **Double-click to collapse:** Industry standard (Logic Pro, VS Code) - faster than dragging all the way
- **Per-project persistence:** Different projects may need different layouts (recording vs mixing)
- **Smart constraints:** Prevent panels from being too small (unusable) or too large (timeline crushed)
- **Cursor feedback:** Changes to resize cursor (↔ or ↕) on hover for discoverability

### Testing Notes
- Tested on macOS with various panel sizes
- Verified persistence across app restarts
- Tested edge cases (collapsed panels, min/max constraints)
- All panel dividers working smoothly with good visual feedback

### Next Steps
Ready to start M6 (MIDI & Piano Roll) with improved UI foundation.

## M5.6: Track Duplication (October 29, 2025)

**Goal:** Add professional track duplication with full state copying (instruments, effects, clips).

**Duration:** 1 day
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What Was Implemented

#### Backend Enhancements (Rust)
- [x] **TrackSynthManager.copy_synth()** - Deep copies synthesizers with all parameters
- [x] **EffectManager.duplicate_effect()** - Creates independent effect instances
- [x] **Clone trait** - Added to all 6 effect types (EQ, Compressor, Reverb, Delay, Limiter, Chorus)
- [x] **Enhanced duplicate_track()** - Now copies instruments and deep copies effects
- [x] **Proper lock management** - Fixed deadlock issues with scoped lock acquisition

#### UI Enhancements (Flutter)
- [x] **Right-click context menu** - Added to track headers and mixer strips
- [x] **Duplicate menu option** - With copy icon and keyboard shortcut hint
- [x] **Delete menu option** - With confirmation dialog (already existed)
- [x] **Instrument mapping sync** - Flutter copies instrument data when track duplicated
- [x] **Callback system** - TrackMixerPanel notifies DAW screen of duplication

### What Gets Duplicated
When you duplicate a track, the following are copied:

✅ **Track properties:**
- Name (with " Copy" suffix)
- Volume, pan, mute settings
- Track type (Audio/MIDI)

✅ **Audio/MIDI clips:**
- All clips on the track (Arc references - efficient)
- Clip positions and durations

✅ **Instrument assignment:**
- Full synthesizer state with all parameters
- Oscillator types, levels, detune
- Filter settings (cutoff, resonance, type)
- Envelope parameters (ADSR)

✅ **Effects chain:**
- Independent copies of all effects
- All effect parameters preserved
- Each track has fully independent effect instances

❌ **Not copied (intentional):**
- Solo state (always false on new track)
- Armed state (always false on new track)

### Technical Highlights

**Lock Management:**
- Implemented proper lock scoping to prevent deadlocks
- Three-phase approach: (1) read source, (2) create track, (3) copy properties
- Each lock is acquired and released cleanly

**Effect Deep Copying:**
- Each effect instance is cloned (not shared)
- Changing effect parameters on one track doesn't affect the other
- Matches Ableton Live's duplication behavior

**Instrument Copying:**
- Copies all 12+ synth parameters
- Updates all voice instances with new parameters
- Maintains polyphony and voice state independence

### Files Modified
**Rust (engine/):**
1. `src/synth.rs` - Added copy_synth() method
2. `src/effects.rs` - Added Clone trait to all effects, duplicate_effect()
3. `src/api.rs` - Enhanced duplicate_track() with instrument and effect copying

**Flutter (ui/lib/):**
4. `widgets/track_header.dart` - Added context menu with duplicate/delete
5. `widgets/track_mixer_strip.dart` - Added context menu
6. `widgets/track_mixer_panel.dart` - Added onTrackDuplicated callback
7. `screens/daw_screen.dart` - Added _onTrackDuplicated() handler

### Usage
1. **Right-click** on any track (timeline header or mixer strip)
2. Select **"Duplicate"** from context menu
3. New track appears with:
   - Same instrument and all its settings ✅
   - Independent effects (change one, doesn't affect other) ✅
   - Same clips ✅
   - Same mixer settings ✅

**Just like Ableton Live!**

### Testing
- ✅ Duplicate MIDI track with synthesizer → instrument copied
- ✅ Duplicate track with effects → effects are independent
- ✅ Adjust parameters on duplicated track → original unaffected
- ✅ No crashes or deadlocks
- ✅ Builds successfully (Rust warnings only, no errors)

### Next Steps
Ready to start M6 (MIDI & Piano Roll) with complete track management features.

## Development Best Practices

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start each day** by reviewing this doc and checking off completed tasks
2. **Commit often** (every feature or bug fix)
3. **Write tests** for critical audio code (playback, recording, export)
4. **Profile performance** weekly (use `cargo flamegraph` for Rust, Dart DevTools for Flutter)
5. **Document decisions** (add notes to this doc or `ARCHITECTURE.md`)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests:** Rust DSP code (verify EQ frequency response, compressor gain reduction, etc.)
- **Integration tests:** FFI bridge (call Rust from Flutter, verify results)
- **Manual testing:** Play, record, mix, export — test every milestone deliverable
- **Performance tests:** Measure CPU usage, memory, latency

### When You Get Stuck
- **Audio issues:** Check [Rust Audio Discourse](https://rust-audio.discourse.group/), CPAL GitHub issues
- **Flutter issues:** Flutter Discord, StackOverflow
- **FFI issues:** `flutter_rust_bridge` GitHub, examples repo
- **DSP algorithms:** Read "Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++" by Will Pirkle, or "The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing"

---

## Appendix: Key Technical Decisions

### Why Rust?
- Memory-safe (no segfaults on audio thread)
- Compiles to native + WASM (future-proof for web/mobile)
- Growing audio ecosystem (`cpal`, `symphonia`, `fundsp`, etc.)
- Fast and efficient

### Why Flutter?
- Cross-platform UI (macOS, iPad, web, mobile from one codebase)
- Fast iteration (hot reload)
- Good performance (Skia rendering)

### Why Firebase?
- Simple auth + cloud storage
- Free tier generous for early users
- Well-integrated with Flutter

### Why Local-First?
- Works offline
- Fast (no network latency)
- User owns their data
- Cloud is optional enhancement

---

## Final Notes

This plan is **aggressive but achievable** if you work consistently (~15-20 hours/week). Adjust timelines based on your availability. The key is to **ship each milestone in a working state** — even if rough — and iterate.

**Good luck building Boojy Audio!**
